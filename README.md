# UFO_Challenge_11

# Overview of Project:

The primary goal of this code is to develop a webpage that will allow viewers to easily navigate data related to UFO sightings. This information can be filtered by 
entering commands into the designated areas. 


# Results: 
From the filtering system users can esily locate the different areas that have reported UFO sightings. A user will need to filter the data based on date, city, state, county or shape of craft. Depending on the results the information will be generated for the user returning the intormation requested. 


Summary: While the new filtering system is helpful, one of the draw backs could be the amount of information necessary or asked. The question of shape is a little confusing, so altering this information to say something similar to craft shape might mitigate this issue. An opption to reduce the inputs and have half filtered information may also be useful as well, incase a user is unfamiliar with certain aspects of the sighting.
